           Micro Systems Development Dual Disk Drive Model SD-2    
                   Latest updates or corrections  3-18-03

     USER MANUAL.TXT is the operators manual for the MSD SD-2 dual 5.25 disk 
drive, an after-market unit made to be used with the Commodore PET, C64 and 
VIC-20 computers. The manual totals about 50 pages. 
     There are three drawings in the manual, and these are rendered as .gif 
files and called figure1.gif, figure2.gif and figure3.gif. The four pages of 
schematics are likewise in .gif format and are labeled schem1.gif, 2, 3 and 4. 
     The ROM and RAM locations (text files) are the only pages I have from an 
MSD service manual, other than the schematics. They were not part of the 
owners manual.
     All of the text was scanned pages (some difficult even for me to read) 
and converted with OCR software as much as possible. Some of the pages were 
in such bad condition that considerable editing (corrections) had to be done. 
The entire process took about four days. I have gone over it several times 
for accuracy, but a few mistakes MAY have slipped through anyway. You might 
let me know if you find any glaring errors. Thanks!
