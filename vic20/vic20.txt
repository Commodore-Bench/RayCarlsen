           COMMODORE VIC20 COMPUTER - DIAGNOSTICS AND REPAIR 
              latest additions and corrections  10-26-2020

     There are two basic versions of the VIC20. I've only seen one of the 
very early 1980 model designated as the VIC20-E, so it must be rather rare.
Therefore, I'll not discuss that one any further here. That board and the 
later standard VIC20 are easily recognized from the outside by the two pin 
connector used for 9VAC power. The power supply for that model is a 9 volt
transformer rated at 3 Amps AC. It's about half the size of the C64 PS. 
Earlier boards are larger and have two large black heat sinks for the 
bridge rectifier and 5 volt power regulator. Since most of the power 
supply is inside the computer, those early VIC20's run warmer inside. 
     The later 1981/82 VIC20 is different than the earlier ones. The board 
is smaller and uses fewer, more integrated chips (CR or cost reduced) but 
still uses the same basic chips as the earlier board. It has a 7 pin DIN 
connector and uses the same power "brick" as a Commodore 64 but draws 
more power from that supply than a C64. The computer itself runs cooler 
than earlier versions because the power regulators and their heat sinks 
are in the PS and not in the computer.
     Because of the differences in boards and some chip ID numbers, I will
list the two versions separately in the chips vs symptoms portion of this
article. Although TTL (so-called "glue logic") chips are rather robust, any 
part can fail at any time. Two IC's that do seem to fail most often are the
VIC and Kernal ROM. Note that all semiconductor devices (transistors, diodes 
and ICs) that normally run hot fail more often than those that run cooler. 
I noticed the VIC chip inside the metal cover runs hot in all models and 
should therefore have a metal heat sink that touches the metal cover of the 
enclosure above it. I've seen many failures of that IC due to overheating. 
That's why I always install a heat sink on it when I get a VIC20 on the 
bench for repair. The sink consists of a thin strip of metal epoxied to the 
top of the IC and with ends bent upwards to touch the shield cover when 
it's reinstalled. (See the photos) That draws the heat away from the IC and 
transfers it to the metal cover. Another common failure is the Kernal ROM 
UE12, a Commodore 901486-06. Either chip failure will cause a blank screen. 
Note that a completely dead VIC will not display any change on the monitor 
screen when the computer is switched on. If the VIC is working and the 
Kernal is bad, the screen will darken (blank screen) when the computer is 
turned on. It's advisable to install a heat sink on any IC that normally 
runs hot to make it last longer. The BASIC ROM next to the Kernal also runs 
pretty hot but I've yet to see one of those fail. That said, a heat sink is 
cheap insurance. 
     Other than that, the IC's directly connected to external ports such as 
the VIA and interface logic can be damaged due to external voltage "spikes" 
and surges. That's why you should avoid plugging or unplugging anything 
with the computer powered up. 
     The last part of this article will tell how to troubleshoot problems
and offers some diagnostic procedures you can do with little or no test
equipment. Careful observation is important. As with other Commodore
computers, the easiest way to test suspected chips is by installing them,
one at a time, in a working board. If a chip is soldered in (no socket), 
it makes it that much more difficult to swap them for tests. Minimum 
equipment for board rework includes a vacuum desoldering iron, a 
volt-ohmmeter and basic hand tools.
     Since the VIC20 has no internal RF modulator, you need to either use
the factory external RF converter box that plugs into the 5 pin A/V port 
on the computer (to feed the RF input of your TV), or use a direct A/V 
connection to a monitor or TV A/V inputs. The USA version outputs a 
signal on TV channel 3 or 4 (switchable) and the European version on TV 
channel 36. Note that the RF converter itself (the ones made in Japan) 
suffers a common problem. See the article regarding that repair.
     The VIC20 opening screen should appear within about four seconds 
after power up. It has a cyan border and blue letters on a white 
background. The full screen is 22 characters wide by 23 high. At power up, 
it should look like this:

*******************************************************************

     Diagnosis of chip and other failures is often difficult, but there
are some things you can try to narrow the diagnosis to a specific fault.
Blank screen is the most common symptom, and it can be the most difficult
because there are many potential causes, including power supply (internal
in the early version VIC20) faults. Note the difference in the two terms:
blank screen and white screen. Blank refers to a dark screen (called a
"raster") with no border and no characters. White screen is likewise blank
with no border and no characters, but brighter than a "blank" screen.
     An AM radio tuned to the lowest point on the dial (off station) can be
used to see if the computer is generating RF interference (which is normal).
The digital signals inside a computer are like little transmitters, and an
AM radio held nearby can pick up those signals. Keep the TV or monitor off
for this test as it generates strong interference of its own. The VIC20
startup sequence to opening screen takes about four seconds and produces
characteristic sounds at power up. If you are used to the sounds it normally
makes, that can be used during diagnostics. For example, if the computer
generates normal interference sounds in the radio, it indicates the 
microprocessor and support chips are working, and a blank screen may be a
VIC chip problem. Of course a total failure of the VIC chip will produce a
white screen and little noise in the radio because nothing is running in the
computer except the master oscillator. Clock signals go through the VIC chip
to feed the rest of the computer.
     Early VIC20 computers have a rather high input current and you need to
make sure the fuse is tight in the fuse holder. If it's loose in the clips,
the fuse and socket will get hot from the slight bit of resistance in the 
contacts. The resulting B+ voltage may be too low to run the computer 
properly and the fuse may eventually open due to the heat. Make sure the 
clips are clean of dirt and corrosion, and squeeze them together to make a 
tight fit before the fuse is installed. Likewise, make sure the power plug 
is tight in the receptacle. If necessary, squeeze the plug end gently with 
a pair of pliers to crimp its internal contacts (be careful not to crush 
them), to make a tight fit before plugging in the supply to the computer. 
Loose connections at the socket will cause intermittent operation or no 
power to the computer. Another common trouble spot in the early version is 
the solder connections on the large bridge rectifier under one of the black 
heat sinks. I often resolder it just to make sure it's making good contact. 
Also, be sure to tighten the heat sink on that bridge block. Every early 
version VIC20 I've worked on had a loose screw mounting the diode to the 
sink, which was making the diode run very hot. If left that way, the diode 
will actually get hot enough to un-solder itself and/or fail (usually by 
shorting and blowing the fuse) eventually. Rather than removing the entire 
bottom metal shield, I cut it from hole to hole at the diode area with 
snips, then cut away the plastic to get at the mounting screw underneath. 
As preventive maintenance, tighten the screw and apply a dab of epoxy to 
the threads to keep it from getting loose again. A nut (metric) will keep 
it tight forever. 
     Speaking of contacts, one preventive (and diagnostic) step you can take
is to reseat all the socketed chips. The contact point between chip and
socket is very small and a bit of corrosion or dust can cause intermittent
operation or a "dead computer" symptom. Lift up each end of the chip with a
small screwdriver and press it back down to wipe the contacts. Don't pry
against the PC board or you may damage the traces (printed "wires"). No need
to remove chips for this procedure, but if you do, make sure the pins are
straight when you reinstall them. A bent pin is sometimes impossible to see
(unless the chip is removed again) and the resulting failure or intermittent
adds yet another problem.
     One diagnostic check you can make on a "dead" computer is to feel each
of the chips and see if any are getting hot. Some chips (the large ones like
the microprocessor and the VIC) will run very warm to the touch after the
computer has been running for awhile. There is quite a bit of variation in
normal chip temperatures, so a bit of experience helps in diagnosis. Some
chips run almost cold and it's perfectly normal, but if you find a cold VIC
after running the computer for ten minutes, it may be bad. If a replacement
also runs cold, the chip is either not getting power (no +5 volts on pin 40)
or the ground has opened up (pin 20). I had such a failure in one board. The
white screen and "radio check" told me the computer was nearly dead. The
master oscillator was running (checked with an oscilloscope) and the chip
had +5 volts on pin 40. The chip was replaced and it still didn't work. It
turns out the socket was at fault. It was likely damaged because of a bent
IC pin on a previous VIC chip installation. The ground return (pin 20) for
the chip was open circuit. I was able to repair the socket by bending the
receptacle for pin 20 back so it made proper contact with the new chip when
it was inserted. I only mention this to show how a "simple" fault can be
VERY hard to find. Unexpected or illogical faults like that one really burn
up bench time and frazzle a technicians nerves. It's not a "normal" failure,
but it happens often enough to keep us humble.
     As a diagnostic, the computer will still start up with a select few of
the chips removed, such as the two VIA chips, the character ROM, & UC2. If 
you suspect one of those chips is shorted and producing a blank screen, you 
can remove them to see if the computer will then start up. Obviously, without 
a character ROM you will not have a normal screen display but a normal border 
should appear. Swapping the two VIA chips can help diagnose which one is bad. 
Faults will follow the bad chip. 
     A stuck (shorted) keyboard key can be isolated by unplugging the keyboard 
and powering up the computer without it, or substituting another keyboard. C64 
keyboards work on VIC20s and (for some versions) internal parts can be 
interchanged as well. Keys that require a hard press to make them work are 
probably worn out (or dirty). If you don't have spare parts handy, the 
conductive rubber plunger can be swapped for a little-used key to get that 
one working again. If several keys are bad, you might try wiping the 
contacts gently with a clean sheet of paper. Of course that requires the 
keyboard be taken completely apart (many tiny screws and some unsoldering).
     Power supply problems account for quite a few failures. As I mentioned
before, there are two different versions of the VIC20 and each requires the
appropriate power pack. Early version boards use a single 9VAC source
(transformer-only inside the power pack) at a rather hefty 2 Amps. That 
kind of supply rarely fails. The rectifier, filter capacitors and regulator 
are all inside the computer. You'll notice the two large black metal heat 
sinks when you open it up. That version is easy to identify by its two pin 
power connector instead of the round DIN socket of the later VIC20CR.
     Later version VIC20s use the same supply as a C64, so there are two 
voltages: +5VDC at 1.5 Amps and 9VAC at 1 Amp. It's helpful to know that a 
VIC20 draws more power from the supply, so if the power pack is marginal, 
it may still work with a C64 but not with your VIC20. It's best to use one 
of the "beefier" after-market repairable supplies, especially if you plan 
to use accessories like RAM expansion or game cartridges. They draw power 
from the computer supply. If the 5 volt source is low or missing, the 
computer will not work at all and the red power light will not come on or 
will be dim. If the 9VAC is missing because of a bad supply or open 1 Amp 
fuse in the computer, the red power light will come on and the computer 
will work except for no cassette power and no 9VAC to the user port. 
It might therefore go unnoticed. If the fuse is blown, look for a short on 
one of those ports. Accidental mis-contact while connecting to a port (with 
the computer turned on) is usually the cause of an open fuse. Avoid 
connecting or disconnecting -anything- with equipment turned on!
     The above information may help get your computer going again, but keep
in mind that actual computer faults can be a challenge even for experienced
techs. There is a limit to what the novice can repair him/herself. I've been
in the repair business for over 40 years and I still sometimes damage a
chip or board trace when removing components from a Commodore computer or
drive. It's just not that easy to do. So, if you have a major problem with
your VIC20, it's probably best to start looking for another one or contact 
a repair tech. If a computer is uneconomical to repair, it's advisable to 
keep the bad one for parts. Chips are scarce now, and we need to salvage
whatever we can to keep our systems running as long as possible.
