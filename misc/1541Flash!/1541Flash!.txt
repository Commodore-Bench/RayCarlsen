     Reading the code of the ROMs shows the name Bryce Nesbitt 1984. 
The two 2764 EPROMs are DRVROM.BIN checksum 0E91 for the drive and
and KERN.BIN checksum E2CB for the Kernal. I have a 1541FLASH! 
setup with a cable between C64 and 1541 but was never able to get 
it working to fastload programs. I did work out some of the drive 
commands by just poking around with it. Not having any documention 
back then, I gave up.
