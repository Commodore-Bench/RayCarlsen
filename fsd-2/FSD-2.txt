     "GOLDEN IMAGE" OCEANA ELECTRONICS CORP. TAIWAN  FCC ID: GLB339OC-118  

     I don't have a schematic for this drive. It apparently goes under several
other names such as the Excelerator+Plus and the Oceanic OC-118N. It is a clone 
of the Commodore 1541-II REV 4 as it uses the same Commodore DOS ROM code in a 
single 16K ROM. However, two of the pins (D3 pin 15 and D4 pin 16) were swapped 
and the original Commodore code was altered accordingly, presumeably in an 
attempt to circumvent Commodore copyrights. The DOS ROM is the only socketed IC, 
a 27128 equivalent 16K PROM which has a checksum of 9677. A Commodore DOS ROM 
IC will work in this drive if pins 15 and 16 are physically interchanged. One 
way to do that is to cut the pins of the replacement chip close to the body of 
the IC, leaving enough stubs to solder to, then connecting wires from the socket 
to the correct IC pins. JiffyDOS is available for this drive, but a 1541-II JD 
chip will work if the two IC pins are swapped, as above.
     The Excelerator uses a twist-door mechanism similar to a Newtronics. 
However, there was no indentification info on mine, so I can't tell who 
manufacturered that mechanism. The drive has 2 device select switches on the 
bottom, similar to the ones on the rear of the 1541-II. It is factory set as 
device 8 with both switches up (on). 
     The drive uses an external power supply that provides two voltages: 5VDC 
at 1 Amp and 12VDC at 0.5A. Its PS is like the one for the 1581/1541-II but 
the connector is different, namely a five pin DIN. I didn't get a PS with my 
Excelerator drive so I "pigtailed" a connector onto the end of my 1581 PS. 
The connections are as follows, shown facing the rear of the drive:

    +12VDC -----0             0----- +5VDC

      ground -----0         0----- ground
                       0----- no connection
