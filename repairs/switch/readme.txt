             REPLACING THE POWER SWITCH IN A C64 OR C128
             Latest updates and/or corrections: 6-23-2012

     I never found an exact replacement for the power switches in a C64
or C128. FYI: they both have the same physical dimensions but the 128
draws more current and its switch needs to have a higher current rating.
     I did find a suitable replacement toggle switch from MCM
Electronics. I believe they ship all over the world. If they still have
the number 26-580, that works fine but the mounting is a bit different.
I used a length of bus wire wrapped around the threads and soldered to
the board where the original switch was anchored. The photos also show 
how the new switch terminals are wired.
     Jumpers can be used to turn the computer on until you can replace
the  switch. Note that the photos of the switch are on a C128 board, but
the connections will be the same for the C64. Electrically, the power
switch in both computers is a DPDT (double pole, double throw) but only
half of the switch is used (DPST), one side for the +5VDC and the other
for the 9VAC. The remaining terminals are not used.
