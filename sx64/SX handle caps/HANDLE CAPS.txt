                  REPLACING THE BLUE END CAPS ON THE SX HANDLE  3-13-2012

     When walking to the local store, I noticed a bottle cap on the ground that closely matched the color of the end cap of an SX computer. I picked up the cap and took it home. Lo and behold, after trimming the cap, it fit perfectly on the SX handle! I used a ring of clear silicone sealer (bathtub caulk) to secure the cap to the handle. That allows it to be easily peeled off again if the handle ever requires service. The CBM factory used double sided tape to hold the original caps. IMPORTANT: if you use glue to secure the new caps, don't get any adhesive on the center screw that holds the handle to the computer. That screw remains stationary when the handle is moved and adhesive there will tear loose as the handle is rotated. Apply the glue only to the perimeter of the replacement cap where the original double-side tape was!

  1. I searched the store for a bottles with caps like the one I found and determined that Lucerne brand 2% milk sold by Safeway grocery stores had the light colored cap. The darker cap is more common and two brands of 2% milk I found use that cap, Great Value sold by Walmart and Darigold brand. I seem to remember that some brand of juice also had light blue caps but I didn't find any at the local stores.
  2. Here is a closeup of the two different colored caps.
  3&4. Scissors or an X-acto knife can be used to trim off the perimeter of the caps.
  5. This is their appearance after trimming off the perimeter plastic.
  6. An additional trim of the plastic may be done using a coin or a thick washer as a guide. This is necessary so the cap sits lower in the handle groove, as the original cap did. 
  7. The finished part is ready to be glued into place. 
  8. The original cap and the replacement look very similar. 
  9. The darker cap will serve as a replacement if you can't find the lighter colored one.
