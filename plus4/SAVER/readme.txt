          INSTALLING A COMPUTER SAVER INSIDE YOUR PLUS/4 COMPUTER
                 latest updates or corrections: 6-27-2014

     You can install a Saver module without removing the PC board from the 
case. To begin, you need to cut a board trace to open the line between the 
power connector and power switch. Scrape the paint off the copper ends so 
you can solder wires there. Solder the input, output and ground wires as 
shown in the photos. 
     When mounting the Saver, it's very important the module be physically 
isolated from the computer components so its metal base plate doesn't cause 
a short. You can use double-sided tape or some other kind of adhesive to 
secure it at the rear of the PC board. There is very little room between 
the PC board and the keyboard when the case top is put back. Anything in 
that area that sticks up will be crushed. Therefore, it's best to mount 
the Saver module at the rear of the PC board, as shown in the photo.
