                PROMOS 2.0 SOFTWARE BOOKLET and DISK
                               for
              JASON-RANHEIM PROMENADE C1 EPROM BURNER 
           latest updates and/or corrections: 5-11-2012

NOTE: Some text in this document differs from the original booklet!!!   
     
     In converting this operators manual to straight ASCII text files, 
a few modifications to the text on some pages were necessary. This is
because of two characters that exist on the Commodore keyboard but
are not found on standard IBM type keyboards, and are not part of the 
standard USA character set. They are the British Pound symbol and the 
pi symbol. The UK Pound symbol appears on the Commodore keyboard between 
the minus (-) and the CLR/HOME keys and is CBM ASCII 92. This symbol 
looks a bit like a handwritten (in cursive) uppercase letter L with a 
dash through the center. The pi symbol is the standard greek letter. It 
is seen on the front face of the up-arrow key on the Commodore keyboard 
as a graphics character and is CBM ASCII 126. 
     In the "Promos 2.0" program written for the Jason-Ranheim 
Promenade C1 EPROM burner, these two keys are used for specific commands 
in the software. I elected to use double brackets {} to substitute for 
the British Pound symbol as that key combination is not likely to be seen 
anywhere else. The pi symbol likewise has no ASCII equivalent, but I 
simply used PI in the text wherever that symbol appeared. 
     The following is a listing of where these changes were made:
Table of Contents page: both symbols replaced one time each.
Page 7: Pound symbol replaced four times.
Page 12: PI symbol replaced twice.
Page 14: Pound and PI symbols replaced one time each.
Page 15: Pound symbol replaced once.
Page 18: Pound and PI symbols replaced one time each.

     Pages of this booklet were scanned and saved to disk as .PCX
graphics files, then converted to ASCII text with OCR. As anyone 
who has used Optical Recognition software realizes, the quality of 
the original image is of utmost importance. The quality of the type 
in this booklet was marginal, so quite a bit of manual correction 
was necessary to the resulting text. In many places, the software 
could not determine the difference between 0 and O, - and =, S and $,
I and 1, etc. I therefore went over each page three times to check 
for and correct errors, and I'm reasonably sure there are none at 
this point. It is simply the best I can do.     

     The first page of information (inside front cover) in this 
booklet is not a numbered page. It is a statement of the copyrights 
and warranty information for the burner and software. That file is
listed as FORWARD.TXT. It is not listed in the table of contents.
     The Table of Contents is not a numbered page. The file is     
TOC.TXT.
     The image on page 5 was called out as "Figure 1" in the text. 
That file is saved as a graphics file named FIGURE1.GIF. It is a 
pinout diagram of some of the various EPROMs that can be read and 
programmed in this burner. The original booklet is hard to read and
the resulting scan is likewise difficult. Consult an EPROM data book
if you need exact information regarding chip pinouts.
     The "inside back cover" mentioned in the text is not a numbered 
page. It is saved as EPROMS.TXT and has a page header as follows: 
Table of Control and Program Method Words. It is not listed in the
table of contents. 
     The blank page after page 24 is not numbered. It contains only
the header NOTES and no information.
     Other than the above pages, all numbered pages in this book 
are saved with file names of their respective pages ie PAGE1.TXT,
PAGE2.TXT, etc. The last numbered page is 24. 

     This scanned document is not intended to defraud the orginal
author or infringe on any copyrights. It was only done to support
an otherwise unsupported Commodore accessory. Since the manufacturer
no longer builds, sells or in any way profits from this hardware or
software, it is up to the users themselves to help each other with 
whatever it takes to keep a useable product alive as long as 
possible. It is in that spirit of co-operation that this document 
is made available to end users at no charge.

SOFTWARE DISK IMAGE AND ADDITIONAL ARCHIVE METHODS 

With a home-built X1541 cable and Joe Forster's Star Commander 
software, I created a .d64 image of the Promos disk. This is the
first time I used that system on my old PC and the data looks OK, 
but if there are any problems with it, please let me know!

The Promos 2.0 software disk was also transfered with Big Blue Reader 
to a PC disk and the files stored as standard binaries. The OEM disk 
directory is listed as a text file so that the original disk can be 
reconstructed from these files using that information, if desired. The 
original was a 5.25" CBM format, single sided, double density type.
