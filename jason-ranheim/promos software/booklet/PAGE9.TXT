      BO or just B

   Example:

      B1:R2000,5FFF,0,6:B0

  Here, we combine the bank select commands and the read
  command. First we switch to bank 1 RAM; then we read a
  27128A into the range 2000 through 5FFF in bank 1; then we
  switch back to bank 0 RAM.
      In 128 mode, BASIC starts at 1C01 in bank 0. If no BASIC
  program is being used, useable RAM in bank 0 starts at 1300.

  HOW BIG A RANGE?

      The question arises: How large must the memory range in
  the read command be to insure that each and every byte on the
  EPROM is included? Earlier, we presented a table showing the
  largest EPROM address for EPROMs of various capacities. If
  we start at address 0 on the EPROM and read each address to
  and including the highest address, then we know we have read
  them all. A little reflection will show that all one has to
  do is add this highest EPROM address to the chosen computer
  RAM start address to obtain the necessary computer RAM end
  address. Some examples:

      We want to read all of a 2732 (4k) EPROM into RAM
  starting at C000. Since the EPROM address runs from 0 to
  FFF, the required read command Is:

      RC000,CFFF,0,E0

      A 27256 (32k) is to be read into RAM starting at 4000:

      R4000,BFFF,0,E6  does the job. 4000+7FFF=BFFF.

      A 27128 (16k) is to be read into RAM starting at 3840:

      R3840,783F,0,5  is what is needed.

  THE M COMMAND- Display computer memory.

      This is the command to use to view and alter computer RAM
  data. To illustrate its use we execute the following:

      MA000

      And there appears:

  >A000 3E 41 00 A9 20 FE 84 D0


                             -9-
