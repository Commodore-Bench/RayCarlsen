   for short). The PMW Is discussed at length In Appendix B.
   It tells PROMOS how you want the programming to be done.
       Some examples:

       P2000,3FFF,0,6,7

       This command fills a 2764A completely with data from
   computer RAM in the range 2000 through 3FFF.  The EPROM Is
   programmed from beginning to end. The CONTROL WORD is 6; and
   we have used intelligent programming method #1 as defined by
   the PMW of 7.
       Notice that the P command gives you complete freedom.
   You can take information from anywhere in computer RAM and
   put it anywhere on the EPROM. Suppose you wanted to program
   just one byte on an EPROM:

      P213A,213A,3456,5,A

      In this case, the starting and ending RAM addresses are
   the same, 213A. The EPROM address is 3456. The control
   word, 5 is for the 27128 and we have chosen A for the PMW.
   This command takes a single byte of data at 213A and programs
   it into EPROM location 3456 In the 27128.
      The considerations of RANGE size are exactly the same as
   with the R command. To be sure you are programming ALL of an
   EPROM, add the maximum EPROM address to the computer RAM
   starting address to obtain the computer RAM ending address.
      Some more examples:

      Suppose you wanted to take the data from two 2764's and
   put it on a single 27128A. Here's one way to do it. First
   let's choose to use computer RAM from 2000 through 5FFF to
   contain the data. Read the first 2764:

      R2000,3FFF,0,5

      Now read the second:

      R4000,5FFF,0,5

      Now program the 27128A:

      P2000,5FFF,0,6,6

      That's all there is to It.

     Suppose you wanted to read a COMMODORE Kernal ROM, make
 some changes, then put the altered data on a 2764A. Here's
 how to do it: The Kernal ROM in the C64 is compatible with
 the 68764 (8k) EPROM. The control word Is 30.  Read it in:


                           -13-
