   SETTING UP A RAM BUFFER

       Let's say you're using a 64 mode BASIC application
   program and you want to set aside a large RAM buffer for
   moving data to and from EPROM's and disk that you're sure
   BASIC will not intrude upon. Here's a suggestion. Early In
   your program, execute the following BASIC statement:

   10 POKE55,0:POKE56,64:CLR

   This confines your BASIC program to the 14k from 0801 through
   3FFF.  Now, you have 32k from 4000 through BFFF for your RAM
   buffer; and 8k from C000 through DFFF to use as a utility
   area for ML programs, etc.

   ONE FURTHER IMPORTANT POINT

       A decimal address of 32768 must become a negative number
   when expressed as a numeric variable.  This number will
   decrease to -1 at 65535. This is of concern only for
   addresses above 7FFF. Examination of the following table
   will give you an idea of how to handle this.
