       V command   A5- 00 = verify ok. FF = verify failed.
                   A6,A7- EPROM address at failure.

       C command   A5- 00 = COMP ok. FF = COMP failed.
                   A6,A7- RAM address at lowest failure.
                   A8- Checksum of compared data.
                   A9- Hashtotal of compared data.
       
       H command   A5- 00 = No occurrence. FF = Bytes found.
                   A6,A7- RAM address of first occurrence.

       E command   A5- 00 = EPROM erased. FF = Not erased.
                   A6,A7- EPROM address of lowest unerased byte.

       Note that the C command generates a checksum and a
   hashtotal.  You can use a 'dummy' C command to generate these
   quantities for any range of RAM data.  For example:

       C2000,DFFF,2000

   compares RAM from 2000 through DFFF with itself. In the
   process, the checksum and hashtotal over that range are
   generated and reported.

   SIMPLE SAMPLE PROGRAM

   10 PRINT"INSTALL 27256 IN PROMENADE SOCKET."
   20 PRINT:PRINT"TYPE A CARRIAGE RETURN WHEN READY."
   30 GETA$:IFA$<>CHR$(13)THEN30
   40 {}4000,BFFF,0,E6
   50 S"27256 DATA",8,4000,BFFF:ETC.

   USING BASIC VARIABLES

      PROMOS commands would be of little utility In a BASIC
   program if they could not make use of variable data. The
   PROMOS L and S commands accept a string variable for the file
   name. Any numeric parameters that you want to express as a
   variable- addresses, control words, device numbers, etc. MUST
   USE the INTEGER variable form. These are numeric variables
   with a '%' sign suffix. Regular floating point variables
   will not work. REMEMBER, numeric BASIC variables are always
   DECIMAL quantities. Here's a simple example of the use of
   variable quantities in a program:

   10 NM$="MY FILE":DN%=8:LS%=8192:REM DEFINE PARAMETERS
   20 LNM$,DN%,LS%:REM LOAD "MY FILE" STARTING AT $2000 FROM
      DEVICE 8.
   30 ES%=0:CW%=5:PM%=7:REM DEFINE PARAMETERS FOR PROGRAMMING.
   30 LE%=PEEK(166)+256*PEEK(167):REM CALC LOAD END ADDRESS.
   40 PLS%,LE%,ES%,CW%,PM%:REM PROGRAM 2764 EPROM.

                            -19-
