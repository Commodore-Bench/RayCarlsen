   USING PROMOS COMMANDS IN A BASIC PROGRAM

       PROMOS commands can be used in a BASIC program just like
   any regular BASIC command. Of course, PROMOS must be loaded
   first and active or your BASIC program will not run.
       Some of the commands work a little differently from a
   running program as compared with direct mode:
       First, control messages such as 'SEARCHING FOR',
   'PROGRAMMING', etc. are not printed unless you enable then by
   setting bit 7 at address 9D high. See the PROGRAMMERS
   REFERENCE GUIDE for details.
       Those commands which from direct mode report results on
   the screen, such as R, P, L, S, V, C, H, and E, do not do so
   when executed from a running program. Rather, certain
   results are made available in low RAM locations as detailed
   below. Your BASIC program can 'PEEK' these locations to make
   use of this Information.
       In general, address A5 (165 decimal) reports errors. If
   an error Is detected, A5 will contain FF, otherwise it will
   be 0. A6 and A7 will report an address in low-high order,
   with the significance described below.  A8 and A9 report the
   appropriate checksum and hashtotal respectively of the data
   in the address range involved in the command.

       L command   A5- 00 = Load ok. FF = load failed.
                   A6,A7- Address of highest byte loaded.
                   A8- Checksum for data loaded.
                   A9- Hashtotal for data loaded.

       S command   A5- 00 = Save ok. FF = Save failed.
                   A6,A7- Address of highest byte saved.
                   A8- Checksum for data saved.
                   A9- Hashtotal for data saved.

       R (or {})   A6,A7- Address of highest EPROM byte read.
                   A8- Checksum for data read.
                   A9- Hashtotal for data read.

       P (or pi symbol)  A5- 00 = PGMing ok. FF = PGMing failed.
                   A6,A7- EPROM address at failure.
                   A8- Checksum for data programmed.
                   A9- Hashtotal for data programmed.
