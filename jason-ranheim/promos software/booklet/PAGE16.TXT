   address so you know where in RAM the data is. Oftentimes,
   it's a good Idea to jot these addresses down. As with the S
   command, you cannot load into the range D000 through DFFF
   from 64 mode. In 128 mode, if you want to load the file Into
   bank one RAM, first set bank 1 with the B command.
       There is one other important feature of the L command:
   you can specify your own load-start address. This is
   mandatory if you want to load a PGM file whose load-start
   address is unknown or if you want to load it someplace else.
   To specify your own load-start address, just add it to your L
   command:

       L"2532 DATA",9,6000

       The load-start address of this file we know to be 2000.
   But we have forced the data to be loaded at 6000 by means of
   this command.
       This feature makes it very easy to merge separate PGM
   files Into one.

   THE Q COMMAND- Quit PROMOS.

       Should you wish to disengage PROMOS, use the Q command.
   Just execute:

       Q

   and PROMOS is gone. You can re-enable PROMOS by executing
   the following SYS:

       SYS320

       COMMODORE 128 users can switch to 64 mode using the G064
   command, then re-enable PROMOS using SYS320 from 64 mode.
   After a RESET, you can use SYS320 to re-enable PROMOS in 128
   mode without having to reload the program.

   THE Z COMMAND- Zero the PROMENADE programming socket.

       This command sets the voltage at all pins of the C1
   socket to (nearly) 0 volts so EPROM's can be safely installed
   and removed. This is done automatically for the most part.
   C128 users will notice that after a 128 mode LOAD or SAVE,
   the red light is left on, indicating an energized condition.
   Here is where the Z command comes in. Execute this command
   to reset the C1 socket.
