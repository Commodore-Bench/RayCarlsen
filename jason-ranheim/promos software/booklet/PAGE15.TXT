             R2000,3FFF,0,6:N=0

         This reads the master and initializes the count. Now:

         P2000,3FFF,0,6,6:V:N=N+1:?:?"TOTAL COPIES:"N

    THE S COMMAND- Save computer RAM.

       This situation continually arises: You've read a ROM or
    an EPROM. Now you want to save the data on disk so that you
    can make a copy later. The S command is what you need. It
    causes a defined section of RAM to be saved to disk as a PGM
    file. An example:

         S"EPROM DATA",8,4000,BFFF

         This command takes data from 4000 through BFFF and stores
    it on disk as the program file called EPROM DATA.
    Experienced users will recognize this as the same S command
    their monitor programs have provided them for years. But
    NOTE one important difference. Monitor S commands require
    that you specify a range one byte longer than what you really
    want to save. This is the case with the C128's built-in
    monitor. With the PROMOS S command, you specify the range
    exactly.
         There is one important restriction on the use of the S
    command in 64 mode: You cannot save from the address range
    D000 through DFFF. This restriction does not apply in 128
    mode.
         One further note for 128 users: If you want to save from
    bank 1, just use a prior B command to set bank 1 RAM first.
         Another example:

       {}2000,2FFF,0,18:S"2532 DATA",9,2000,2FFF

         Here, we read a 2532 and save the data to disk on drive 9
    as a PGM file called '2532 DATA'.

    THE L COMMAND- Load program from disk.

         Now, you have the data on disk.  How do you get that data
    back Into the computer so an EPROM can be burned from it?
    The answer Is the L command. An example:

         L"2532 DATA",9

         This command loads the PGM file '2532 DATA' back into the
    same locations in memory from where it was saved, namely 2000
    through 2FFF, from device 9. On completion of the load,
    PROMOS reports the load start address and the load end
