       Execution of this N command causes the computer to
   display the specified address followed by eight hexadecimal
   byte values- the data from locations A000 through A007. To
   display a memory range, from 2000 through DFFF, say, type:
       M2000,DFFF

       The screen fills and then scrolls rapidly as the data is
   printed. To stop the display at any point, press the
   RUN/STOP key. To begin the display again at the point where
   you stopped, type M alone and a carriage return.
       Notice the 'M' command displays RAM data, not ROM or IO
   devices which may overlay a particular address.

   CHANGING RAM DATA

       Suppose you want to change the data In memory somewhere.
   Just use the M command to display that area, move the cursor
   into the display to the desired location, type in the new hex
   value(s) and press RETURN on each altered line.  RAM data is
   changed accordingly.  You can also change the address field.
   In this way you can quickly copy data from one area of RAM to
   another.

   THE I COMMAND- Display ASCII data.

       This command works the same way as the M command except
   that the display shows printable ASCII characters rather than
   hex data. Thirty two characters appear on each line.

       For example:

       I6000,7FFF

   Displays ASCII characters In the range 6000 through 7FFF.
   You canNOT alter an ASCII string by over-typing and pressing
   RETURN.

   THE F COMMAND- Fill computer RAM.

      This command fills a specified range of memory with a
   specified data byte. For example:

      F2000,DFFF,FF

      This command fills memory from 2000 through DFFF with FF
   characters.

   THE T COMMAND- Transfer RAM data.
