    GETTING STARTED

        With the power OFF, plug your PROMENADE into the user
    Port at the left rear of your COMMODORE 64 or 128. Install
    the PROMOS 2.0 diskette In your 1541, 1571 or 1581 disk
    drive. Turn ON your computer. If you are in 128 mode, the
    software will load automatically. If In 64 mode, type:

        LOAD"P*",8,1 <CR>

        The <CR> above means 'type a carriage return'.

        You will shortly see a brief sign-on message and
    copyright notice. At this point, your system is ready.

    HANDLING EPROMS

        EPROM's need to be handled with reasonable care if one is
    to avoid irretrievable damage to them. They are very
    susceptible to static electricity. This can be a problem in
    a cold, dry climate in the wintertime. Always discharge
    yourself by touching a grounded object before handling them.
    The aluminum case of the PROMENADE itself is convenient for
    this purpose.
        To install an EPROM In the PROMENADE socket, RAISE the
    operating lever, drop the EPROM Into place and then close the
    socket by moving the lever down to the case as far as it will
    go. NOTE- EPROM's having 24 pins (e.g. 2716, 2732) use the
    RIGHTMOST 24 socket positions. Twenty eight pin EPROM's
    occupy the entire socket. MAKE SURE the orientation notch
    points to the LEFT as the figure on the top of the cover
    indicates.
        NOW TO INSURE PROPER ELECTRICAL CONNECTION to all pins of
    the EPROM, move the EPROM from side to side slightly by
    forcing it with the thumbs. This may take quite a bit of
    force. Doing this becomes habitual after a while. The
    objective here is to have the contacts in the socket cut
    through any tarnish films which might otherwise prevent
    proper operation.

    HEXADECIMAL NOTATION

        If you are already familiar with HEX notation, skip this
    section. If not, you will need to spend a little effort at
    this point to aquaint yourself with a very useful idea.
        In the world of EPROM's and computers, information is
    conveyed in little units known as 'BITS'.  A bit can have one
    of two values.  The meaning we associate with these values
    can be anything capable of expression as a 'binary' or
    two-valued entity.  For example, a statement can be either


                              -2-
