   This command copies data in a specified range from one area
   of computer RAM to another. By way of example:

       T2000,2FFF,C000

       This command transfers data from RAM in the range 2000
   through 2FFF to C000 through CFFF.
       Another example:

       T4000,40FF,4001

       This command moves data from 4000 through 40FF up one
   address location.

   THE C COMMAND- Compare computer RAM data.

       This command causes the computer to compare the data in
   one range of memory locations with that of another. The
   address of all locations where the data differs is printed
   out. For example:

       C100,1FF,4000

       This command compares RAM data in the range 0100 through
   01FF to data In the range 4000 through 40FF. The addresses
   of all discrepant locations appear on the screen.

   THE H COMMAND- Hunt for byte data.

       This command causes the computer to hunt for occurrences
   of a group of specified data bytes. The address of each
   occurrence is printed on the screen. The sought for group
   may be up to seven bytes long. For example:

       H2000,BFFF,20,D2,FF

       This command examines ran from 2000 through BFFF for the
   byte sequence 20,D2,FF: 6502 code for JSR FFD2. Another
   example:

       H1000,7FFF,52,41,4E,47,45 49,4D

       This command hunts for a group of seven ASCII characters.

   THE D COMMAND- Scan EPROM data.

       The D command reads data from an EPROM and prints it on
   the screen as hex data just as the M command does. Computer
   RAM is not affected. Example:



                            -11-
