    location still does not verify, programming stops and the
    failure is reported.

        Intelligent #3- In this method, the margin pulse is 4
    times the preceding total accumulation. If after 15 ms of
    pulses verification has not been achieved, a 60 ms pulse is
    tried. If the location now verifies, programming moves on.
    If not, the EPROM has failed.
       For any of the Intelligent programming methods, the EPROM
    Supply (VCC) is set to 6 volts.
       PMW's from 4 to F have the meanings given In the
    following table:

       PMW   INT METHOD  TEST PULSE  TOTAL ACCUMULATION*

        4         1       variable          12 ms.
        5         1       variable          25 ms.
        6         1       variable          50 ms.
        7         1       variable         100 ms.
        8         2         .25 ms.         75 ms.
        9         2         .50 ms.         75 ms.
        A         2         1.0 ms.         75 ms.
        B         2         2.0 ms.         75 ms.
        C         3         .25 ms.        100 ms.
        D         3         .50 ms.        100 ms.
        E         3         1.0 ms.        100 ms.
        F         3         2.0 ms.        100 ms.

       * = the maximum time that can be accumulated at a
   location before an error Is reported.
       If you add $40 to the PHW, that is set bit 6 high, the
   programming is altered in this respect: The PROMENADE turns
   off Vpp before attempting to read back the EPROM. This slows
   down programming; but it is advisable in few cases.
       For example:

       PC000,C7FF,0,28,47

   This command programs a 27C16 with data from C000 through
   C7FF. Another example:

       P4000,BFFF,0,E6,46

   This programs an OKI 27256 with the specified data.
