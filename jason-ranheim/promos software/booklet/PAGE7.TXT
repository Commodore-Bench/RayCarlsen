   you typed them. For example:

       Print "ZERO PAGE RAM":M0,FF:Print"END OF ZERO PAGE"

       REMEMBER: ALL PROMOS 2.0 COMMAND PARAMETERS ARE ENTERED
   AS HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS.

   ERRORS

       If you make a mistake typing in a PROMOS command, chances
   are you'll be advised by the SYNTAX error message. If you
   fail to supply all the parameters required by a command, an
   UNDEFINED FUNCTION error will result. If you input incorrect
   hexadecimal numbers, an ILLEGAL QUANTITY error will be
   reported. Some PROMOS commands report other errors as may be
   necessary.

   PROMOS 2.0 COMMANDS

   THE G COMMAND- Print command Glossary.

       This isn't really a command at all. Type a G and a
   carriage return and a list of the PROMOS commands and an
   example of each is printed on the screen. If you commit
   only one command to memory, make it this one.

   THE R (or {}) COMMAND- Read EPROM data into computer memory.

       By reading an EPROM, we mean transferring some or all of
   the information it contains into the computer's memory. The
   key letter can either be R or {}, the English monetary symbol.
   Example:

       R2000, 3FFF, 0, 6

       The meaning of this command is: fill computer RAM from
   2000 to 3FFF with data from this EPROM, beginning at EPROM
   address 0000. The '6' is a parameter called the CONTROL
   WORD. It is a number that tells the PROMENADE everything it
   needs to know about the particular EPROM you are dealing
   with. In the example, 6 is appropriate for the 2764A. A
   list of control words appears inside the back cover of this
   manual. A detailed discussion of control words and what they
   mean is presented in APPENDIX A.
      Another example:

     {} 5000 BFFF 1000 E6

      Here, we have used the {} symbol rather than R. The
   command does exactly the same thing either way. In this
