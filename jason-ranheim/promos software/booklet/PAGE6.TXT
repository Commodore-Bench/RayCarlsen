       The user has to be concerned with only one of these other
   voltages. This Is a relatively high value called the
   PROGRAMMING VOLTAGE. There are three standard programming
   voltages in general use: 12.5v, 21v, and 25 volts. As we
   shall see a little later, the user must specify this voltage
   for the particular EPROM he is dealing with.

   ENTERING PROMOS 2.0 COMMANDS

       All of the various tasks you will want to accomplish
   using the PROMENADE will be done by means of one or more
   PROMOS 2.0 commands. These commands consist of a key letter
   followed by up to nine hexadecimal numbers called parameters.
   To execute a PROMOS 2.0 command, simply type it on the
   screen. Edit it as required and then type a carriage return.
       Multiple parameters in your command may be separated by
   one or more spaces or by (at most) one comma. You do not
   need to supply a '$' sign nor are you required to supply
   leading zeros. The following examples of the PROMOS 'M'
   command will serve to illustrate. This command Is used to
   display the contents of computer memory on the screen, and
   it will be described In detail later.

       M0000 03FF
       M0000,03FF
       M0 3FF
       M0,3FF
       M    0              3FF
       M 00   ,  03FF

       All of these forms are equivalent. PROMOS does not
   perversely require that you type in an exact form as long as
   your meaning is unambiguous.

   MULTIPLE COMMANDS

       You may enter two or more PROMOS commands separated by
   colons on the same command line. The commands will be
   executed sequentially in the order you typed them. For
   example:

       M2000,2040:12000,2040

   results in a hex display of computer RAM data from 2000
   through 2040, followed by an ASCII display of the same data.

   MIXING BASIC AND PROMOS COMMANDS

       You may mix PROMOS and BASIC commands together on the
   same command line. They will execute in the order in which
