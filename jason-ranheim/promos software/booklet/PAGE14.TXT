       {}2000,3FFF,0,30

       Use the M command to change the data in RAM as you wish
   it to be. Now program the revised data into the 2764A:

      P2000,3FFF,0,6,7

   PROGRAMMING ERRORS

       While programming an EPROM, PROMOS checks to see that the
   job is being done correctly. If an error is detected,
   programming is stopped and you are advised what happened by
   messages on the screen. For suggestions on determining the
   source of the trouble, see the section on troubleshooting.

   THE V COMMAND- Verify EPROM data.

       The V command compares the data on an EPROM with data In
   computer memory. It has two forms: the long form, with
   parameters exactly the same as in the R command; and the
   short form which is just V alone with no parameters at all.
   The short form uses the parameters from the most recent R or
   P command. The EPROM addresses of all discrepant locations,
   the checksum and the hashtotal are printed on the screen.
       Some examples:

       V2000,3FFF,0,6

       Here, we compare data from 2000 through 3FFF with the
   data on a 2764A.

       P4000,BFFF,0,E6,6:V

       Here, we have programmed a 27256 with data from 4000
   through BFFF and have followed with the short form of the V
   command.

   COPYING EPROMS

       The PROMENADE is a very efficient piece of production
   equipment. One can quite easily program 250 2764's in an
   hour. The usual procedure is to read an EPROM MASTER into
   RAM using the R command, then program the duplicates using
   the P command. It isn't necessary to type a new P command
   for each copy. Just move the cursor up to the P command line
   and press RETURN.
       Here's a simple example of a command that programs
   2764A's, verifies the data, keeps track of the number of
   copies that have been made and prints it on the screen:


                             -14-
