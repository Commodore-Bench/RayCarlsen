A customer's extensively modified C128DCR came in with a failed power supply. 
I could repair it but he wanted an upgrade to a better one, so that's what I 
did. The switcher board output is +5VDC at 5.5 Amps and +12VDC at 2 Amps, both 
higher than the original PS. The transformer is 9VAC rated at 1 Amp (old one 
was 0.5A). The new PS runs barely warm to the touch after an hour.
