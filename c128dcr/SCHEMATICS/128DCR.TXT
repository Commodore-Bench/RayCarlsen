     From FUNET.FI:
These are the schematic diagrams of the Commodore 128DCR main board 
(metal case C128D with built-in 1571CR floppy controller). The 
diagrams were scanned from a 64'er Sonderheft, and they appear to 
be a copy of schematic 252451.
     According to Nicolas Welte, there was an error on the right 
half of page 5. The 74LS14 hex Schmitt-trigger inverter U113, 
pin 13 is connected to WPRT* (misprinted WTRT* on U105), which 
doesn't make any sense. Obviously it should be connected to STP1 
instead, which is three lines more to the right!
