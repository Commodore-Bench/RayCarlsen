              HOW TO USE A C128 KEYBOARD ON A C128DCR

    The keyboard from a "flat" C128 will work on your C128DCR (USA 
version in the metal case) computer with an adapter cable. Note that a 
straight-through (pin 1 to pin 1, etc.) will NOT work. The adapter has 
to be wired with pin 1 and pin 13 reversed and all other pins similarly 
cross connected. The easiest way to do that is with 25 wire ribbon cable 
and two male 25 pin Dsub connectors. The line on one end of the cable 
normally indicates pin 1. Wire one end that way and reverse it for the 
other connector. I didn't have a crimper to secure those connectors so 
I used my shop vise to do the job. You can use pliers but the jaws will 
mar the connector face unless you protect it somehow. 
    One other thing that needs to be done to make the C128 plug fit the 
hood of the Dsub connector is to trim the edges off the plug. I used a 
file to round off those edges and make the connector fit properly. This 
doesn't alter it, so it can still be used with a C128 computer.
