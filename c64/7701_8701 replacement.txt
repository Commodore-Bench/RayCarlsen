There is now an excellent drop-in replacement for the clock chip used in the 
later C64 motherboards and the C128 series of computers. The original IC can 
be either a 7701 or 8701. The replacement is called the TOLB (8701 upside down) 
from Francois Leveille <eslapion@videotron.ca> in Canada. The module IC runs 
cool, takes less power and will likely outlast the computer. I recently 
purchased four TOLBs and am pleased to say they work very well. The NTSC 
version is now available and a PAL version should be available soon.
