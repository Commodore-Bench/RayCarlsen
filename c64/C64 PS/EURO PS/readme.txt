I own one of these 110/220V power supplies and I discovered only recently 
that it uses pin 4 for +5V, unlike the standard C64 black or white "brick" 
that connects it to pin 5. Both supplies work on the C64 because the power 
connector inside the computer has those pins tied together! Note that if 
the square connector is changed to a round one on a Plus/4 so a standard 
CBM supply can be used, those pins are already tied together by traces on 
the motherboard, and both USA and European supplies will work.
