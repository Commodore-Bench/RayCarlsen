             latest updates and/or corrections 5-22-2013

     There is very little space inside the 1541 drive case. One place that 
a fan will fit is just under the top cover, using the metal shield to hold
the fan in place. I notched the shield with tin snips and cutters to mount 
a 2" X 2" X 1/2" 12V fan. Notice it's off to one side instead of in the 
middle. That was done to leave room for the JiffyDOS module. I used Silicone 
Rubber Sealer (RTV) to glue the fan in place. It's important to not allow 
the fan rotor to touch the board chips or capacitors. I bent the caps down 
as far as possible and put a spacer over those board components. I then 
temporarily mounted the shield, set the fan in place and used the RTV all 
around three sides. Most fans will have arrows on the case to tell the 
direction of the blades and of the airflow. You want the flow upwards.
     When the glue cured, I removed the spacer and connected the fan to a 
nearby 12VDC source, the smaller of the two large filter capacitors. I used 
alligator clips so I could easily remove it later when the drive needed 
maintenance. That filter capacitor has about 11 volts DC on it (good enough 
for a fan) and is ahead of the regulator so no additional load is put on it. 
Note the plastic foam strip just behind the fan. It's there to direct the 
airflow to the rear of the drive and out the vent holes at the top. With 
the fan running, I can feel the airflow from that vent with the back of my 
hand, slight but there, and with no holes drilled in the case.
