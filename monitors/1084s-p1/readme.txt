The CM8833 chassis was made by Philips and sold under the Magnivox name 
as well as Commodore and Philips. There are slight differences in the user 
inputs but the motherboard is the same in the other models. For example, 
one version has separate Y and C inputs and a DIN connector and another 
has CVBS (composite video with burst and sync) RCA jacks and switches to 
select Y/C or composite, and still another has only composite and no Y/C. 
Such monitor boards have blank spaces for the "missing" parts. Each monitor 
version was made for a specific use such as with the Amiga which outputs 
analog RGB, whereas a TTL RGB monitor input is for the C128.
