The schematic matches a 1084S-P monitor except for the crazy flyback
numbers. I removed the bad flyback from a monitor I was repairing and
traced the connections back to identify the pin numbers... some were
correct and others were way off. So, I took a section of the diagram
and corrected the flyback pin numbers. See photo "alt flyback #s.jpg"

When repairing this chassis, the vertical size control was intermittent.
The picture size would change if the control were bumped and would also 
change even if the control were not moved at all. The control resistive 
surface develops a bad spot and makes the control intermittent. This is 
apparently a common problem with this monitor. Rather than replace the 
control, I changed the value of one resistor, R534 390 ohm 1/2 Watt to 
a 1K resistor. This shifts the control range a bit and allows the control 
to work normally so it doesn't sit on the bad spot any longer.
