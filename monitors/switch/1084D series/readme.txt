REPLACEMENT SWITCH FOR THE 1084S-D AND SIMILAR MONITORS     7-15-2014

This series of photos shows the procedure when replacing the power switch in a 1084S-D. 
Figure 1 is the original factory switch. It is a common failure in all Commodore monitors. 

Figure 2 shows the old switch and the new, side by side. Note the tape I put on the pairs 
of wires. That keeps the two bundles separate so they don't get crossed when installing 
them on the new switch. 

Figure 3 shows two wires disconnected from the old and soldered to the new. 

Figure 4 shows the finished connections. 

Figure 5 show the tip of the switch actuator cut off so the switch will engage and disengage 
properly when installed. If you cut too much off, the switch may not engage and you'll have 
to find a way to add length to the actuator again sucH as a piece of sleeving from a thick 
wire. An alternate way to do the install without cutting the actuator is shown in the other 
(alternate) multiple-photo. Note the shims installed to allow more space between the front 
panel and the actuator. If one or the other of these procedures is not done, the switch will 
not disengage after mounting it. 

Figure 6 is the completed installation. Note that the switch is mounted facing the other way 
than the original. That's necessary so the mounting screw that holds the plate to the front 
panel can be accessed after the switch is mounted on that plate.
