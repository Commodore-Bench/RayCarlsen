This European PAL monitor features a SCART connector, 3 RCA jacks for separated 
Luminance and Chromanance (Y/C, much like S video) or composite and audio, an 
8 pin DIN for TTL RGB (C128), a switch to select video or RGB and one to select 
Y/C or composite video (L/C/A - CVBS). The VCR switch is used to select the 
horizontal AFC recovery time (faster response best for videotape playback).
