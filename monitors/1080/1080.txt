                       AMIGA 1080
        latests updates and/or corrections 4-6-2015

I just got a schematic for this Commodore monitor. The diagram was one
of those gigantic fold-out ones that are very difficult to duplicate. 
Through the efforts of a friend who owns the manual, I was able to piece
it togther from several scans stitched together. Hopefully there are no
missed spots or errors where the edges didn't align correctly. I did the 
best I could to correct such mistakes. 
     The 1080 was made by Toshiba and is unlike any other CBM monitor. 
My other schematics will not substitute. Note that it is nearly identical 
in outward appearance and features to Commodore monitor models 1902 (non-A 
model) and 1084made by NAP (Philips). However, the internal construction, 
components and board numbers are completely different. I own a 1080, and 
I have collected some information about it to assist those who might have 
to repair one. The chassis number of my monitor is TAK8520. Although the 
construction of this monitor makes troubleshooting difficult because of 
crowded boards, all boards are silkscreened on both sides with component 
identifier numbers. All internal controls are marked as well. 
     Note that each section of the monitor is numbered, and that can be 
used to locate components in each circuit. The following is viewed facing 
the rear of the monitor with the back cover removed. The bottom main PC 
board contains the Horizontal Sweep, HV, Vertical and low voltage power 
supply circuits. The PC board designation for the H sweep section is 400 
(example: H output transistor is Q404). The vertical sweep section is 
designated 300. The power supply is 800. The left upright mounted PC board 
is analog video and digital signal processing (100). The audio amplifier 
(600) board swings away to the left (remove two screws) for better access 
to it and the bottom board. The rear upright PC board is an A/V and RGB 
connector interface and has both 100 (signal) and 600 (audio) components on 
it. Lastly, the CRT board (500) mounted on the neck of the picture tube 
contains the driver and output transistors for the CRT. The Low Voltage 
Power Supply (LVPS): main switcher transistor is Q801, a 2SD1432. The line 
fuse is a 3 Amp F801, and the B+ fuse is a 1.2 Amp designated F802. Both 
fuses are on the bottom PC board in fuse clips. HV & Horiz Sweep: the 
Horizontal (line) Output transistor is a 2SD1427 Q404 and the flyback (line 
output transformer) T461 is a TFB5017AD, which appears to be a Panasonic part 
number. The vertical circuit in this monitor uses descrete components (no 
ICs). The output transistors are Q304 2SC2073 and Q305 2SA940. There is a 
service switch in the center of the bottom board towards the left side. That 
switch should be in the NORMAL position. If in SERVICE, the vertical sweep 
will collapse to a single horizontal line, which is used for CRT setup 
adjustments.

The following is from an unknown poster on comp.sys.cbm:

                      Amiga 1080 Monitor Modifications

   A number of Amiga 1080 monitors were built by Toshiba. The people at
   Toshiba could have done a better job in a couple of respects:

   First, they did a poor job of extracting vertical sync pulses from the
   video signal that comes from the Amiga. This produces an error in the
   interlacing when the Amiga is used in 320x400 or 640x400 display modes.
   When you look closely at the screen you see alternating line spacings. It
   also gives characters a ragged look.  The modification described in the
   dPaintII file reduces the interlace error by a factor of about 5.
 
   While interlaced video isn't the nicest thing to read characters on, it's
   neat to be able to put nearly all of a typewritten page on the screen. Most
   of the Amiga outlets handle a neat thing called Jitter-Rid, or some such
   thing.  It is a thick piece of smoked plastic that goes on your 1080
   monitor. It enhances the contrast and attenuates the light from the screen
   to keep your brain from rattling too badly from the flicker. Also, dark
   characters on a light background seem to work best for me, anyway.

   The second problem is a thing called crossover distortion. They did a dumb
   thing that distorts the audio, even at very low volume levels. The Amiga
   deserves better sound. Unfortunately, this mod takes 2 diodes and a
   resistor, but it essentially eliminates the crossover distortion.

   If you aren't afraid of working on the average modern TV set, the 1080
   shouldn't prove to be much of a problem. Looking from the back, there are
   four screws, one at each corner. You need a long Philips screwdriver for
   those. There is a bottom plate that that also needs to come off. Finally,
   there is a screw just above the RGB input connector. Now, if you place the
   monitor face down on a soft towel, you can, with a little judicious prying
   and tugging, lift the rear part of the case off. Watch out for the speaker
   lead. You will have to unplug the connector before the back can come clear
   off.

  You will need to have something to support the neck of the CRT. A 1x4 about
  3-4 inches long worked pretty well. The whole assembly is pretty limber, so
  use reasonable caution. The main board on the bottom can be slid back along
  with all of the front-panel knobs. This permits access to the controls - you
  might as well squirt some contact cleaner in there while you are at it.

  If you are looking at the bottom, with the face of the CRT on your right,
  you will see a large IC that is the guts of the whole thing right in the
  middle of the board. C304 is visible above and to the left of the centerline
  of that humongous IC.

  The board that contains the audio output amplifier is on the left side of
  the 1080 if you are facing the screen. Looking at the underside of the
  board, the components you are looking for to do the audio mod are on the
  upper left corner.

  Fortunately, the P.C. boards have component numbers screened on them, so it
  isn't too hard to find the parts. I did the audio mod by lifting the
  collector lead of Q605 out of the hole and wiring directly to it. In
  retrospect, it probably would have been easier if I had just soldered an
  insulated wire to it, brought the wire through the hole and done all of the
  wiring on the backside of the board. If you are concerned about vibration
  messing up the "air-wired" connections, a shot of hot glue or some similar
  measure should put your mind at rest. The diodes are 1N914s from Radio
  Shack, but most any small-signal silicon diode should do.
